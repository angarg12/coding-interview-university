## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track progress.

Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes

## Don't feel you aren't smart enough

- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.
- [The myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ)
- [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)

## About Video Resources

Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. These are called MOOCs.
Sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access.

## Before you Get Started

Here are some mistakes I made so you'll have a better experience.

### 1. You Won't Remember it All

I watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn't remember. I spent 3 days going
through my notes and making flashcards, so I could review.

Please, read so you won't make my mistakes:

[Retaining Computer Science Knowledge](https://startupnextdoor.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/).

A course recommended to me (haven't taken it): [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

### 2. Use Flashcards

To solve the problem, I made a little flashcards site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code.
Each card has different formatting.

I made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone and tablet, wherever I am.

Make your own for free:

- [Flashcards site repo](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards)
- [My flash cards database (old - 1200 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham.db):
- [My flash cards database (new - 1800 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham-extreme.db):

Keep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics. It's way too much for what's required.

**Note on flashcards:** The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't mark it as known. You have to see the
same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in
your brain.

An alternative to using my flashcard site is [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), which has been recommended to me numerous times. It uses a repetition system to help you remember.
It's user-friendly, available on all platforms and has a cloud sync system. It costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.

My flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560 (thanks [@xiewenya](https://github.com/xiewenya)).

### 3. Start doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures and algorithms

You need to apply what you're learning to solving problems, or you'll forget. I made this mistake. Once you've learned a topic,
and feel comfortable with it, like linked lists, open one of the coding interview books and do a couple of questions regarding
linked lists. Then move on to the next learning topic. Then later, go back and do another linked list problem,
or recursion problem, or whatever. But keep doing problems while you're learning. You're not being hired for knowledge,
but how you apply the knowledge. There are several books and sites I recommend.
See here for more: [Coding Question Practice](#coding-question-practice).

### 4. Review, review, review

I keep a set of cheat sheets on ASCII, OSI stack, Big-O notations, and more. I study them when I have some spare time.

Take a break from programming problems for a half hour and go through your flashcards.

### 5. Focus

There are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music
without lyrics and you'll be able to focus pretty well.

## The Daily Plan

Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.

Each day I:
- take one subject from the list below
- watch videos about that subject
- write an implementation
- and write tests to ensure I'm doing it right, sometimes just using simple assert() statements

Why code in all of these?
- Practice, practice, practice, until I'm sick of it, and can do it with no problem (some have many edge cases and bookkeeping details to remember)
- Work within the raw constraints (allocating/freeing memory without help of garbage collection (except Python or Java))
- Make use of built-in types, so I have experience using the built-in tools for real-world use (not going to write my own linked list implementation in production)

You don't need to memorize the guts of every algorithm.

Write code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then test it out on a computer.

NOTE: With COVID and remote interviewing, whiteboarding is less relevant now. Even if you arrange an on-site interview, ask to write code in a computer, either your own or one provided by the company.

## Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

- Nothing to implement
- There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review
- If some lectures are too mathy, you can jump down to the bottom and watch the discrete mathematics videos to get the background knowledge

## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [ ] Description:
        - [Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/arrays-OsBSF)
        - [UC Berkeley CS61B - Linear and Multi-Dim Arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_Wp8oiO_CZZE) (Start watching from 15m 32s)
        - [Dynamic Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/dynamic-arrays-EwbnV)
        - [Jagged Arrays (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jtrQqYpt7g)
    - [ ] Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [ ] Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.
        - [ ] New raw data array with allocated memory
            - can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features
            - start with 16, or if starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128
        - [ ] size() - number of items
        - [ ] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [ ] is_empty()
        - [ ] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [ ] push(item)
        - [ ] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [ ] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [ ] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [ ] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [ ] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [ ] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [ ] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [ ] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [ ] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists
    - [ ] Description:
        - [ ] [Singly Linked Lists (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/singly-linked-lists-kHhgK)
        - [ ] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 1 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_htzJdKoEmO0)
        - [ ] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 2 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_-c4I3gFYe3w)
    - [ ] [C Code (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN6FPiD0Gzo)
            - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation
    - [ ] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays-rjBs9)
        - [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays-QUaUd)
    - [ ] [why you should avoid linked lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)
    - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.
        - [Pointers to Pointers](https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx8.html)
    - [ ] Implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [ ] size() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [ ] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [ ] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [ ] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [ ] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
        - [ ] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [ ] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [ ] front() - get value of front item
        - [ ] back() - get value of end item
        - [ ] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
        - [ ] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [ ] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
        - [ ] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [ ] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
    - [ ] Doubly-linked List
        - [Description (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/doubly-linked-lists-jpGKD)
        - No need to implement

- ### Stack
    - [ ] [Stacks (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/stacks-UdKzQ)
    - [ ] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial

- ### Queue
    - [ ] [Queue (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/queues-EShpq)
    - [ ] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [ ] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

- ### Hash table

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes:
    - There are 4 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - adjacency matrix
        - adjacency list
        - adjacency map
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their trade offs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none

## Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- Gathering requirements for the problem
- Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- ~~Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer~~
- Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- Testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:
[Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)

Supplemental:

- [MIT Interview Materials](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906124824/http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php)
- [Exercises for getting better at a given language](http://exercism.io/languages)

**Read and Do Programming Problems (in this order):**

- [ ] [Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job, 2nd Edition](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047012167X.html)
    - answers in C, C++ and Java
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - answers in Java

## Coding exercises/challenges

Once you've learned your brains out, put those brains to work.
Take coding challenges every day, as many as you can.

## Have questions for the interviewer

    Some of mine (I already may know answer to but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?
- How is work/life balance?

## Once You've Got The Job

Congratulations!

Keep learning.

You're never really done.
